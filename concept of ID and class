## Internal CSS – Specificity Example

This example uses Internal CSS written inside the `<style>` tag.

The element has both:
- A class selector (.box)
- An ID selector (#special)

Even though both apply styles, the ID selector has higher priority.
That is why the background color becomes red.

### Additional Notes:
- A div without width/height only takes space of its content.
- To show a proper box, we set width:200px and height:100px.
- We also used flexbox to center the text "Saif" inside the box.

### Key takeaway
CSS follows a priority system:
Inline CSS > ID selector > Class selector
